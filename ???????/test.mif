EXERCISE ASSIGNMENT:

Create a Makefile for the C program whose source code is in the folders "inc"
(header files) and "src" (source files). The source code should not be moved
from these folders.

When you have completed your work, make sure to ***push*** your Makefile onto the
Git ***remote repository***.  Failing to do so is equivalent to failing the
exercise.

The Makefile should contain distinct rules for the following tasks:
compile the source code, run the program, and clean the working directory.

A successful execution of the program generates the following output:

-- console output start --------------------------------------------------------

WAMI kernel 1 parameters:

Input image width = 512 pixels
Input image height = 512 pixels
Output image width = 508 pixels
Output image height = 508 pixels

Starting WAMI kernel 1 (debayer).
Validation checks passed -- the test output matches the golden output.

Writing output to ./small_kernel1_output.bin.

-- console output end ----------------------------------------------------------
